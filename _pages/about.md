Hi there! I am a PhD Candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Washington, and I value collaborating with interdisciplinary researchers and community partners. I grew up in Fallbrook, CA, and graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a B.S. in Mathematics (emphasis in Statistics) and minor in Spanish, engaging in several community service projects during my undergraduate years.

As a NIH NHLBI Diversity Supplement Recipient, I work with Dr. Robyn McClelland at the Collaborative Health Studies Coordinating Center. We are investigating reasonable ways to use nutritional information from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to identify heart-healthy diets. We propose using partial least squares methods with variable selection to capture the most scientifically-relevant aspects of food that are predictive of heart health, rather than using the current unsupervised methods in nutritional science.

In general, my statistical interests include supervised methods, variable selection, epidemiological studies, intervention evaluation, and data visualization. Applied topics that motivate me are food justice, immigrant health, obesity, and complementary medicine, particularly in the context of community-engaged research. I also enjoy consulting for and collaborating with scientists from various fields (e.g. cardiology, reproductive health, environmental health, dentistry, school psychology, and social work). Lastly, it is important to me to communicate my findings to audiences with less technical backgrounds in both English and Spanish.
