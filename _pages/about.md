Hi there! I am currently an Outreach and Legislative Analyst at the California Department of Pesticide Regulation. I grew up in Fallbrook, CA, and graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a B.S. in Mathematics (emphasis in Statistics) and minor in Spanish, engaging in several community service projects during my undergraduate years. I earned a Ph.D. in Biostatistics at the University of Washington, where I focused on constructing and visualizing heart-healthy dietary patterns. I most recently served as a Science Policy Fellow at the California Council on Science and Technology, where I gained insight into how state policymaking and technical communication efforts evolve.

I value collaborating with interdisciplinary researchers and community partners, as well as translating health and scientific studies into data-driven recommendations and visualizations. With over 5 years of experience in public health research, statistical consulting, public outreach, and student mentorship, I have a strong background in data analyses (in R or Stata), visualizations, and presentations; interdisciplinary collaborations; grant writing; and team management. I am excited to be gaining public policy experience at this time, as this training complements my leadership involvement, civic engagement, and mentorship roles undertaken since my undergraduate years. 

In general, my statistical interests include supervised methods, variable selection, epidemiological studies, intervention evaluation, and data visualization. I particularly appreciate working on efforts that focus on food justice, immigrant health, obesity prevention, and complementary medicine, especially in the context of community-engaged research. I am an avid proponent and organizer of initiatives that build community and highlight resources for underserved folks in STEM, as well as those that share research implications accessibly in English and Spanish. I am committed to empowering underserved students and families to achieve their well-being and academic goals.
